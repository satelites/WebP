   Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language <br>
  for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.Web browsers<br>
  receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them <br>
  into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page<br>
   semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <br>
  images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded<br>
  into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents <br>
  by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,<br>
   lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,<br>
   written using angle brackets.
